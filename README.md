0x16. C - Simple Shell Project

This projects looks at recreating the shell the same way as it operates in the terminal using the
core c-programming skills attained in the ALX-programme.
The program has the exact same output as sh (/bin/sh) as well as the exact same error output.

This Shell programme operates in the following way:

Displays a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.
The command lines are made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs.
If an executable cannot be found, prints an error message and displays the prompt again.
Handle errors.
Handles the “end of file” condition (Ctrl+D).
